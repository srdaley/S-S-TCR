The purpose of this file is to provide the code, data and examples of expected output to reproduce the TCR sequencing graphs and summaries shown in Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 6 of our paper. The original TCR sequencing data is in the NCBI Short Read Archive under BioProject ID PRJNA733833 for Fig. 3 and PRJNA734126 for Supplementary Fig. 6. 

Files with "code" in the filename contain code written in RStudio (version RStudio 2022.02.3+492 "Prairie Trillium" Release (1db809b8323ba0a87c148d16eb84efe39a8e7785, 2022-05-16) for macOS

RStudio and tidyverse typically take less than 5 minutes and 1 minute, respectively, to install on a "normal" desktop computer.

Both "fig3.code.R" and "suppfig6.code.R" should take less than 1 minute to run on a "normal" desktop computer.    

Files with "clonotype.table" in the filename contain data, i.e. information about mouse T cell receptor (TCR) sequences collected by multiplex PCR amplification of cDNA molecules followed by Illumina sequencing. Sequences were aligned to the mouse genome using MIGEC software (see doi: 10.1038/nmeth.2960 for details). Except for the header row, each row contains information about a unique TCR nucleotide sequence. Columns 1-11 contain output from MIGEC software. Columns 12-17 contain information about sample origin, detailed as follows: column 12 "sample_id" is an identifier for the T-cell sample; column 13 "genotype" specifies the genotype of the donor mouse ("wt" = wild-type; "zap" = Zap70-mrd/mrt, "dko" = B2mKO.H2AaKO); column 14 "chain" specifies the TCR chain ("a" = alpha, "b" = beta); column 15 "mouse" is an identifier of the donor mouse; column 16 "organ" specifies organ of origin (thymus, spleen or gut); column 17 "subset" specifies the T cell subset of origin ("t_p" = Pre-selection thymocytes; "t_1" = Type A IELp; "t_4" = CD4+ T-conv thymocytes; "t_8" = CD8+ T-conv thymocytes; "g8a" = gdTCR- CD8aa intraepithelial lymphocytes; "s_r" = splenic T-reg; "s_4" = splenic CD4+ naive T cells and "s_8" = splenic CD8+ naive T cells). 

The other files contain examples of expected output. These include ".txt" files that list the values represented in graphs in Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 6 as well as in the Source Data file. The ".pdf" files are examples of graphs shown in Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 6. To reproduce every graph in the paper, certain sections of the code need to be rerun with a new value for "SGOI", defined as "Special Genotype Of Interest" i.e. the genotype to plot or, similarly, "SSOI", defined as "Special Subset Of Interest" i.e. the subset to plot.
